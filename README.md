# pandas-challenge

This challenge was tasked with analyzing the district-wide standardized test results. 

Access was given to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. 

The task however, is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

This assignment uses Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to create a report that includes the following data:

District Summary which includes the following:

Total schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


School Summary which includes the following:

School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing).

A DataFrame was created that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. The DataFrame includes the following metrics:

School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing).

A DataFrame was created that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. The DataFrame includes the following metrics:

School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


Math Scores by Grade.

A DataFrame was created that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade
Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
